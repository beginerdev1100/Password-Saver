# Password Saver-

A small Python program to keep track of account names, emails, and passwords.  
It runs in the terminal and saves everything to a CSV file so itâ€™s available the next time you run it.

## How it works
When you start the program you can:
- Add a new account (name, email, password)
- Look up an existing account by name
- Exit and save your accounts

## Run it
```bash
python password_saver.py
